Introduction {#intro}
============

The Gyroscope API extends the Generic Sensor API [[GENERIC-SENSOR]]
to provide information about the angular velocity around the device's local X, Y and Z axis 
in terms of radian per seconds units.


Examples {#examples}
========

<div class="example">
    <pre highlight="js">
    let sensor = new Gyroscope();
    sensor.start();
    
    sensor.onchange = () => {
        console.log("Angular velocity around the X-axis " + sensor.x);
        console.log("Angular velocity around the Y-axis " + sensor.y);
        console.log("Angular velocity around the Z-axis " + sensor.z);
    };

    sensor.onerror = event => console.log(event.error.name, event.error.message);
    </pre>
</div>

Security and Privacy Considerations {#security-and-privacy}
===================================

There are no specific security and privacy considerations
beyond those described in the Generic Sensor API [[!GENERIC-SENSOR]].

Model {#model}
=====

The Gyroscope's associated <a>Sensor</a> subclass
is the {{Gyroscope}} class.

The Gyroscope has a <a>default sensor</a>,
which is the device's main gyroscope sensor.

The Gyroscope extends sensor's [=latest reading=] with three [=map/entries=] whose
[=map/keys=] are "x", "y", "z" and whose [=map/values=] contain <a>current angular
velocity</a> about the corresponding axes.

The <dfn>current angular velocity</dfn> is the rate at which the device rotates
about a specified axis. Its unit is the radian per second (rad/s) [[SI]].

The sign of the <a>current angular velocity</a> depends on the rotation direction and
it must be according to the right-hand convention, such that positive rotation around
an axis is clockwise when viewed along the positive direction of the axis (see figure below).

The Gyroscope Interface {#gyroscope-interface}
--------------------------------

<pre class="idl">
  [Constructor(optional SensorOptions sensorOptions)]
  interface Gyroscope : Sensor {
    readonly attribute unrestricted double? x;
    readonly attribute unrestricted double? y;
    readonly attribute unrestricted double? z;
  };
</pre>

To <dfn>Construct an Gyroscope Object</dfn> the user agent must invoke the 
<a>construct a Sensor object</a> abstract operation.

### The attribute ### {#gyroscope-attribute}

The <a attribute for="Gyroscope">x</a> attribute of the {{Gyroscope}}
interface represents the <a>current angular velocity</a> around X-axis.
In other words, this attribute returns [=latest reading=]["x"].

The <a attribute for="Gyroscope">y</a> attribute of the {{Gyroscope}}
interface represents the <a>current angular velocity</a> around Y-axis.
In other words, this attribute returns [=latest reading=]["y"].

The <a attribute for="Gyroscope">x</a> attribute of the {{Gyroscope}}
interface represents the <a>current angular velocity</a> around Z-axis.
In other words, this attribute returns [=latest reading=]["y"].

Conformance {#conformance}
===========

Conformance requirements are expressed with a combination of
descriptive assertions and RFC 2119 terminology. The key words "MUST",
"MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.
However, for readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase
letters in this specification.

All of the text of this specification is normative except sections
explicitly marked as non-normative, examples, and notes. [[!RFC2119]]

A <dfn>conformant user agent</dfn> must implement all the requirements
listed in this specification that are applicable to user agents.

The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for
conforming IDL fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
